# Enchantment-Fix

A Forge plugin to disable glint on enchanted items (ver. 1.7.10) to save performance for bad computers

It's a well known issue for older computers without a GPU / Integrated Graphics, enchanted item glint causes a little fuzz when it's rendered, lowering the frames of the user holding the enchanted items. This Forge plugin disables glint completely, making sure your performance is saved.
